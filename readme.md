# `ㄷ`

The ㄷ, pronounced **Diccle**, is a programming language inspired by [compound literals](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/compound_literal) of C99.

```rust
:stdio

main:(){
    print("hello world")
}
```

Diccle is a recursive acronym of "Diccle isn't C compound literal expression". 

At the same time, Diccle (디끌) is a southeast dialect of Digeut (ㄷ) in the Korean alphabet.

## Key Features of Diccle

- No keywords to remember: everything is done with some special characters, yet intuitive.
- Familiar syntax: you'd already know most parts of this language (if you're a developer).
- Multi-Paradigm: object-oriented or functional programming also was considered in syntax.
- Performance: as fast as C. Diccle first compiles to human-readable C.
